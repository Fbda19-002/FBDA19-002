<h1>SHOPPING IN DUBAI</h1>
<h2>The best places to shop in Dubai, from traditional souks to gleaming malls</h2>
<p>Shopping is a national pastime in the UAE, a place where high street and designer brands from around the world stand side-by-side in shiny, air-conditioned mega malls, while old-school souks still look much like the mock historic market on display in Dubai Museum. Elsewhere, emerging artisans are carving a niche off the beaten path. Telegraph Travel expert Sarah Hedley Hymers guides you through the retail temples you simply can’t miss and the ones worth making a detour for.</p>
<h2>Downtown Dubai</h2>
<img src="miracle.png" alt="miracle">
<p>The UAE’s highest concentration of designers boutiques can be found here, alongside the Dubai Aquarium and Underwater Zoo and an Olympic-sized ice rink, while the Dubai Fountain and Burj Khalifa are on the doorstep. Walking through the several million square feet of retail space is a workout: you can navigate with the Dubai Mall mobile app, and be sure to pack comfortable shoes – or buy a pair. With more than 1,300 shops, including anchor departments stores Galeries Lafayette and Bloomingdale’s, finding the right footwear for the job shouldn’t be a problem.</p>
<h2>Al Barsha</h2>
<img src="underwater.png" alt="underwater">
<p>The only place in the UAE where you'll find a ski slope, Mall of the Emirates is a magnet for Middle Eastern travellers who’ve never seen snow. The mall’s Fashion District looks like the pages of Vogue brought to life, with Bulgari, Dior and Gucci stopping shoppers in their tracks with attention-grabbing window displays. High-street offerings include Next, Topshop and the popular Turkish equivalent, Koton, while Harvey Nichols and Debenhams go head to head as the flagship department stores. The 'Hands Free' service means shoppers can have their bags collected and delivered later anywhere in the mall, car parks or connecting hotels (a Kempinski and a Sheraton).</p>
<h2>Jebel Ali</h2>
<img src="mosque.png" alt="mosque">
<p>This incongruous Tuscan village-styled mall on the outskirts of Dubai is to the UAE what Bicester Village is to England. From Armani to Ermenegildo Zegna, several discounted high-end collections can be found in bespoke boutiques or one of three multi-brand department stores: The Deal, Priceless and Galeries Lafayette L’Outlet. Hotfoot it to Coach, Dunhill, Michael Kors and Montblanc for luxury leather accessories, and bag high street bargains at stores including Banana Republic, Gap Factory, Diesel, Superdry and Ted Baker. In addition to the 100 or so shops, there’s a food court and Stay & Play, a care facility where children can be entertained while grown-ups splurge.  </p>
<h2>City Walk</h2>
<img src="old.png" alt="old">
<p>This little shop of curiosities, an outpost of a family business based in Thailand, presents dramatic handcrafted jewellery and home décor inspired by Asian mythology and made from unusual materials, most striking among them the iridescent green wings of the scarab beetle. Outshining the sharpest cut of emerald, large and ornate scarab earrings and pendants emit an almost supernatural glow from within the shop's glass display cases. A bespoke scarab souvenir can cost a few thousand pounds, but it’s sure to remain a talking point for years to come. Slightly more affordable items are fashioned from seeds, nuts, shells and emu eggs.</p>
<h2>Boxpark</h2>
<img src="souk.png" alt="souk">
<p>Taking cues from East London, this container-park concept store narrates an interesting selection of youthful Middle East-inspired clothing, jewellery and homeware. Discover local pop-ups, attend sartorial workshops (announced on their Instagram page) and explore the ever-changing stock of offbeat fashions and Arabia-themed gifts. You may find dresses that look good with trainers, gold-plated hashtag necklaces, slogan caps, feather headdresses, insect motif slippers, coffee table fashion tomes and Hand of Fatima knuckle rings. The location, Boxpark, is a hub of quirkiness, with a programme of street performances and noteworthy neighbouring outlets, including eclectic stationary store Typo and Emirati sweet shop Sukkar.</p>
<h2>Al Wasl Road (Al Manara)</h2>
<img src="culture.png" alt="culture">
<p>On point Middle Eastern mementos can be found at this eclectic boutique showcasing the region’s designers. Twentieth century Egyptian movie star Umm Kulthum is among the local musical legends remembered on clothing, accessories and home décor. You don’t need to understand the Arabic calligraphy of her song lyrics to appreciate the retro-Arabian look of inscribed coasters, cushion covers and clutches. Labels to look out for include Elsa O, with jewellery inspired by Levantine symbology, and Sarah’s Bag, a fashion enterprise that employs underprivileged women in Lebanon to create quirky luxury accessories.</p>
<h2>Alserkal Avenue</h2>
<img src="allnight.png" alt="allnight">
<p>A seductive chocolate aroma welcomes visitors into this artisan factory and café; a table of complimentary samples gets them hooked. Available in single bars, gift boxes and hampers, the Emirati collection is a befitting present for foodies back home. Flavours of the region resound in milk chocolate bars of Ragag, filled with pieces of thin and crispy Arabian ragag bread, and Khabeesa, spiked with dates, cinnamon and cardamom. Located in an avant garde art hub known for its hip and heterogeneous boutiques and galleries, there’s plenty more to purchase in this neighbourhood, especially when fuelled by a sugar rush.</p>
<h2>Al Seef</h2>
<img src="opera.png" alt="opera">
<p>A treasure trove of sugary sweets, exotic herbs and spices and local health and beauty remedies, Zafarana’s shelves bulge with squidgy Turkish Delight; buckets of dried lavender, hibiscus and rose petals; freshly ground coffee laced with cardamom; jars of honey packed with hazelnuts; sticky rolls of halva and baklava; fat dates bursting with dried fruits and pistachios; a hundred plant-based medicinal oils and tubs of slick African shea butter, promising shiny hair, clear complexions and improved digestions. This is a grotto for greedy travellers and the manager is an expert at explaining what’s on the menu.</p>
<h2>Bur Dubai and Deira</h2>
<img src="mosque.png" alt="mosque">
<p>Long before the UAE was born, a cluster of souks formed around the mouth of Dubai Creek, feeding on passing trade from ships. On the left bank stands Bur Dubai’s Textile Souk; abra boats sail passengers across the water to Deira’s Spice, Perfume and Gold Souks. It’s hard to know where one souk ends and another begins as each tends to proffer a similar jumble – saffron, incense, pashminas, fridge magnets, jewellery, lanterns and the odd 'genuine fake'. Get lost in the maze and haggle politely if something catches your eye. Wear noticeable headphones and turn up the volume if you prefer not to be disturbed.</p>
<h2>Various locations</h2>
<img src="culture.png" alt="culture">
<p>Inhale the thousand scents of Arabia at the UAE’s leading fragrance house. Despite its Westernised title, TP – as it’s known – is committed to authenticity. Launched in Dubai in 2013, it now has 16 stores across the Gulf. Its best-sellers are Rose Vanilla and Amber Oud eau de perfumes and Dkhoun TP, the brand’s signature incense tablets, which smoulder atop charcoal in brass burners outside stores located in City Walk, Al Seef, La Mer and JBR The Beach. If any smell can take travellers back to Dubai, then it’s probably this one.</p>

<h1>FASHION IN DUBAI</h1>
<h2>Dress codes for travelers in the UAE</h2>
<img src="woman.png" alt="woman">
<p>In June 2012, two Emirati women began a twitter campaign calling on foreign visitors to respect their culture and adhere to an existing dress code.
Hannan Al Rayyes and Asma Al Muheiri launched their UAE Dress Code page on Twitter because they were “tired of seeing tourists in beachwear or revealing outfits in shopping malls”.</p>
<p>Too many girls in the malls were “wearing shorts so short they looked like hot pants,” Ms Al Rayyes said.


Their first followers tweeted last week about their “disgust” at seeing foreigners dressed inappropriately.


“We don't want people to start wearing the abaya or anything. We're just asking them to cover up parts of the body that are sensitive to our culture,” she said.</p>
<p>There are already laws setting out the dress code, and signs at the entrances to malls – but Emiratis believe those laws are not being enforced.
According to the UAE's The National, Lt Col Mohammed Rashid Al Muhairi, from Dubai Police's Tourist Security Department (TSD), said it was important that the millions of visitors who come to the UAE each year understand local laws and culture.



“We have to take into consideration that there are a lot of nationalities coming here, which means we have to be flexible.”



He said it was police policy to only approach those whose outfits “border on nudity”.



Emirati politicians are now considering a new law to enforce the dress code for foreigners.



Meanwhile on Twitter, UAE Dress Code now has over 2000 followers. Many of them saying foreign visitors need to “respect our culture”.



A few have linked the campaign to the so-called “burqua ban” policies in European nations such as France and Belgium, citing those laws and visitors' disrespect for dress standards as anti-Islamic.



However, the overwhelming sentiment on the Twitter page is that there needs to be more education about Emirati culture and standards for visitors.</p>
<h2>So what's acceptable dress in Dubai?</h2>
<img src="acceptable.png" alt="acceptable">
<p>For women it means covering the shoulders and the knees (and everything in between). Spaghetti straps will raise eyebrows.



You don‘t have to hide your figure, as you do in Iran or Saudi Arabia, but tight-fitting clothing is a no-no.</p>
<p>There's no law requiring you to cover your hair with a scarf (unless you're entering a mosque).



Men should be wary of shorts – knee-length is considered modestly acceptable.



T-shirts with strappy shoulders or very low V-necks will get you some attention you don‘t need (there goes your wardrobe of Bintang singlets from Bali!).



Men shouldn't wear women's clothing (visibly) – that's sure to get you arrested.



Both genders should keep sports clothes on the sports field, including cycling shorts (name me a culture where cycling shorts are NOT considered offensive!).



At the beach, women can wear bikinis that cover all the important bits.</p>
<p>Thongs, Brazillian-style itsy-bitsy bikinis, and going topless are not ok.



Thongs are definitely out for men at the beach, and sadly racing-style costumes (Speedos) are allowed - even on men over 50 - but board shorts and swimming shorts are more acceptable.



Young children can wear almost whatever you want them to, but don't let them run around nude.



Don't wear clothing with potentially offensive slogans or symbols. Think carefully and conservatively about this one. Leave the “I heart Tel Aviv” t-shirt in the suitcase.



This is a different matter in Sharjah and Ajman, both members of the UAE, where Sharia law is dominant. They are very conservative societies and have strict, mandated dress codes. Women should cover upper arms and shoulders down to mid calf. No shorts at all for men.



</p>
<h2>The Bikini Incident</h2>
<img src="bikini.png" alt="bikini">
<p>In 2010, a British woman was arrested after she argued with an Arabic woman who'd accosted her about her bare shoulders. The British woman‘s response was to strip down to her bikini, right there in the shopping mall. She spent 3 days as a “guest” of Dubai police before she got a dressing-down (pun intended) from a judge and the charges were dropped (also pun intended).



Again, in Sharjah and Ajman breaking the code will be dealt with more seriously.</p>


<h2>What if my dress offends in Dubai?

</h2>
<img src="woman.png" alt="woman">
<p>A Janet Jackson-style wardrobe malfunction will see you explaining yourself to police.


</p>

<p>
If what you've chosen to wear doesn't quite meet the dress code, expect to have an Emirati woman come up to you and tell you so. Don't argue with her; apologize and either cover up straight away or promise to go and cover up as soon as possible. If you argue, the police will come. You may not be arrested for arguing (except if you swear), but you could be charged with “offending public decency”, and the word of the Emirati woman will trump you every time</p>

<h1>TOURIST ATTRACTIONS DUBAI</h1>
<h2>Dubai Miracle Garden: World’s Largest Flower Garden</h2>
<img src="miracle.png" alt="miracle">
<p>I bet, even the regular visitors cannot hide the tingling sensation in their feet while visiting the Miracle Garden in Dubailand which is one of most visited tourist attractions.

Conveniently located close to Dubai Creek, it is said to have been established during 1830s, in fact, when you come here, you can still witness the old architecture style and the wooden archways in the market. But wait, let me tell you the best part and the only purpose of your entire trip here is probably to witness a variety of gold displayed on the shop windows and even better buying them with a constant though, you’d only wish you own them all! Besides the gold, the tourists and locals also come and take home varieties of other spices like cumin, saffron, frankincense, rose water and incense from the separate market situated adjacent to the Gold Souk.</p>
<h2>Dubai Aquarium: The Biggest Underwater Aquatic Zoo

</h2>
<img src="underwater.png" alt="underwater">

This tourist attraction is featured to be the largest aquarium in the world and it has approximately 140 variety of aquatic species. You can witness a few as you toddle the 48-meter long walk-through tunnel.
