    <h1>DUBAI HISTORY</h1>
    <h2>Dubai Culture</h2>
    <img src="images/culture.png" alt="culture">
    <p>The history and culture of Dubai is deeply rooted in Islamic traditions that shape a UAE national's lifestyle. It is important to note that when tourists visit Dubai they must respect the culture and behave accordingly, as minority groups in the Emiratis are very protective of their Islamic culture and traditions.
</p>

<p>Dubai is famously known as the entertainment capital of the Middle East which attracts many party lovers from all over the world, especially those who are wealthy enough to splurge on the most expensive places in the city. While Dubai has cultivated this image for its tourists, it still discourages its Islamic nationals to indulge in many of the entertainment services offered. Hence, these services are often located in the more touristy areas rather than in residential parts.
</p>

<p>Alcohol is not forbidden in Dubai, as long as it is confined within the designated areas in hotels, bars or nightclubs. Residents are free to drink in their own homes as long as they have an alcohol licence issued by the municipality. It is illegal to drink in the street or in other public places. Pork is also available for the consumption of visitors and expatriates.
</p>

<p>It is advised that visitors and expatriates do not flaunt their Western culture habits in the streets, where they can be viewed by conservative nationals who may find it offensive.
</p>

<p>Having said this, it does not mean the locals are against foreigners visiting Dubai, it is just common courtesy to respect your hosts. Emiratis are traditionally known for their warm hospitality and they are very generous when offering refreshments to guests. Remember, when in Rome, do as Romans do.
</p>

<h2>Religion</h2>
<img src="images/religion.png" alt="religion">
<p>Dubai, like the rest of the UAE is an Islamic Emirate and once in the city you are surrounded by many mosques and the call of prayer will be heard frequently. The most religious time of the year in Dubai is the Holy Month of Ramadan, which lasts for approximately 30 days. This is when Muslims fast during daylight hours to fulfil their duties to the fourth pillar of Islam. Tourists must be aware that during this period, eating, drinking and smoking is not permitted in public during the day, although some restaurants blackout their windows to allow people to consume food and beverages in private. Bars will not serve alcohol before 7.00pm and nightclubs are shut as no loud music is allowed.</p>
<p>However, the UAE is tolerant and welcoming to foreigners who do not practice Islam. The government follows a policy of tolerance towards non-Muslims and Polytheist and in practice, interferes very little with their religious activities. The huge Arab population in Dubai includes many from Middle-Eastern countries which follow the Christian faith and non-Muslim expatriates. They are freely allowed to practice their own religion as long as they do not publicly distribute literature. In fact, Dubai has other religious places of worship, such as churches, gurdwaras and temples. The Meena Bazaar area of the city has both a Shiva and Krishna temple. Both are believed to be sanctioned by the late ruler of Dubai, Sheikh Rashid Bin Saeed Al Maktoum. There is an electric crematorium run by a group of Indian expatriates. Furthermore, in early 2001, the ground was broken for the construction of several additional churches on a parcel of land in Jebel Ali donated by the government of Dubai for four Protestant congregations and a Catholic congregation. Construction of the first Greek Orthodox Church in Dubai (to be called St. Mary's) was completed in November 2009 with the help of General Sheikh Mohammed Bin Rashid Al Maktoum, Dubai Crown Prince and UAE Defence Minister, who donated a plot of land in Jebel Ali.</p>

<h2>Language</h2>
<p>The official language of the country is Arabic, however most people in and out of the workplace communicate in English. There are so many different nationalities in Dubai and therefore English finds common ground with most people. The majority of road, shop signs, and restaurant menus etc. are in both English and Arabic.</p>

<h1>DUBAI ECONOMY</h1>

<p>Dubai is the second wealthiest emirate in the UAE, after Abu Dhabi which is the capital state. The city is an important trade and tourist destination with its port (JebeL Ali) operates at the centre of export trade in the Middle East. With the introduction of the Dubai International Financial Centre (DIFC) in 2004, Dubai developed as a global hub for service industries such as IT and finance.
</p>

<p>Most tourists believe Dubai’s revenue comes primarily from oil but only a moderate amount of oil reserves were used to generate the required infrastructure for trade, manufacturing and tourism, in order to build up Dubai's economy. Most of Dubai's GDP (over 95%) is non-oil-based. So far oil has accounted for less than 1% of Dubai’s GDP and tourism to produce 20% of the GDP. These figures explain why Dubai has become a more dynamic and diversified economy in order to survive the decline of fossil fuels.
</p>

<p>In the early 1990’s there were only a handful of hotels available for tourists and Dubai never had high oil revenues like Abu Dhabi so something had to change. The Burj Al Project in 1994 (Burj Al Arab Hotel) gave hope to the economy, as a long term strategy, an ambition to become the world’s top tourist destination. Being one of the favorite tourist destinations in UAE, Dubai has seen a tremendous change in its economy in the past 50 years or so.
</p>

<p>Some of the major investments in Dubai have been largely affected due to the recession that hit the global market in the recent past. Even though Dubai's economy was built on the back of the oil industry, most of the city's banking and financial centers headquartered in the port area and service industries got largely affected as Dubai's property market faced a major downturn during 2008-2009 as a result of the global economic slowdown. Most of its ongoing projects along with the jobs of the expatriates got hit as a result. Also, it was made public that Emaar had approximately $70 billion credits and the state of Dubai additional $10 billion while holding estimated $350 billion in real estate assets.</p>

<p>Dubai has also established itself as an international tech hub that services industries such as Finance and IT. Dubai Internet City, along with Dubai Media City forms the TECOM (Dubai Technology, Electronic Commerce and Media Free Zone Authority), which is an enclave who houses well-known IT firms such as EMC Corporation, Microsoft, Hewlett-Packard, Dell, Oracle Corporation and IBM, and media organisations such as BBC, MBC, CNN, Reuters and Sky News.With a promising growth rate of 6.1% in 2014, Dubai is on its way to becoming one of the fastest-growing economies in the Middle East. Dubai has excellent trade relations with multiple countries. By 2014, Dubai’s largest trading partner was identified to be China followed by India and the U.S.
</p>

<p>In recent times tourism has emerged as an important driver of GDP. Dubai welcomed 15.93 million visitors in 2018, retaining its ranking as the fourth most popular destination globally. Dubai has also surfaced as the shopping capital of the Middle East, thanks to its diverse souks, over 100 malls and innumerable shopping centres. Dubai is aptly referred to as the ‘City of gold’, as the city houses nearly 250 gold shops.Dubai has won the bid to host the most awaited Expo 2020, which will give an amazing boost to its economy, and is expected to create over 270,000 jobs.
</p>

<h1>DUBAI GEOGRAPHY</h1>
<p>Dubai is located on the Persian Gulf, to the northeast of the United Arab Emirates. Dubai is the second largest emirate with an urban area of 3885 sq.km. and the city is roughly 35 sq.km. in size. However it is poised to expand to twice this size with the addition of the man-made islands; the Waterfront, the three Palms, the World, the Universe, Dubailand, as well as many other construction projects underway in the desert.</p>

<h2>Geographical Coordinates:</h2>
<h2>25°15'8" N, 55°16'48" E</h2>

<p>One of the most fascinating geographical aspects of Dubai, is the Dubai Creek, which divides the city into two regions- Deira and Bur Dubai. Dubai Creek is a natural 15.2km inlet from the Persian Gulf, around which the city’s trade developed. The region north of the Creek is called Deira, and Bur Dubai refers to the south where a lot of the coastal tourist and residential developments of Jumeirah lie.Dubai shares its borders with Abu Dhabi in the south, Sharjah in the northeast and the Sultanate of Oman in the southeast. Due to the city’s unique geographical location it enjoys a strategic position which allows it to connect to all local Gulf States, as well as to East Africa and South Asia.</p>

On average, Dubai experiences only five days of rainfall a year.</p>

<h2>Population</h2>
<img src="images/population.png" alt="population">
<p>Dubai's population is 3.33 million as of Sept.2019, with three-quarters of the population being male. The city of Dubai is a multicultural society; with only 5% of local Emiratis, the rest are expatriates from all over the world. The expatriate population comprises of mostly Asians, particularly Indians and other nationalities from various neighbouring Arabic countries. There is also a significant number of Iranians, who came in droves after the Islamic revolution in 1979 when the more wealthy and educated Iranians settled in Dubai. Furthermore, because of the high demand of workers primarily in the tourism sector, you'll find many people from the Philippines, China, Indonesia and Malaysia who have become residents in the city.Dubai’s population has been growing by around 5.64% a year and the city has a population density is 408.18 per sq. km.
</p>

<h1>DUBAI GOVERNMENT</h1>
<img src="images/government.png" alt="government"><p>The United Arab Emirates has a presidential, federal, and despotic monarchy. The UAE is a federation of 7 different constituent monarchies, which include the Emirates of Dubai, Abu Dhabi, Ras al-Khaimah, Umm al-Quwain, Ajman, and Fujairah. The President who is also the UAE’s head of state is the ruler of Abu Dhabi while the Prime Minister is the ruler of Dubai and the head of government of the UAE.
</p>

<h2>The UAE's Executive Branch</h2>

<p>Regarding administration, the UAE is a federation of seven emirates and each emirate has its ruler who is responsible for setting the pace for the reforms of local government. Under the 1971 Consitution, the seven emirates share a considerable amount of power in matters of revenues and mineral rights which is mostly oil. Since each emirate initially had its system of government, the development of federal powers has been slow.
</p>

<h2>Division Of Power According To The Constitution</h2>
<p>UAE's Constitution divides the federal powers into the judicial, legislative and executive branches. Besides, the executive and legislative powers are further divided into emirate and federal jurisdictions. The Constitution also established the role and position of both the President and the Vice President who are elected rulers from the seven emirates. The seven rulers form the Federal Supreme Council comprising of both a chairperson and vice chairman who are elected to serve a term of five years, the cabinet lead by the Prime Minister, and an independent judiciary including the Federal Supreme Court. Other members of the Federal Supreme Council include 40 members of the National Assembly, a supreme council of rulers, members of a consultative body featuring partially elected and appointed members by rulers of the seven emirates.
</p>

<h2>Responsibilities Of The UAE Government</h2>
<p>The UAE government has different responsibilities under the federal authority including, security and defense, public health, foreign affairs, education, nationality and immigration issues, extradition of criminals, labor relations, currency, banking, licensing of aircraft, air traffic control services, telephone, postal, and other communications. However, certain responsibilities are excluded from the Constitution's Article 120 and 121 but are under the jurisdiction of each emirate.
</p>

<h2>Local Politics Within The UAE</h2>
<p>>Each emirate has a different degree of financial influence and prestige; this is openly seen by how positions in the federal government are allocated. For instance, The President of the UAE hails from Abu Dhabi which is a major producer of oil. Since Dubai a former oil producer is the current commercial hub for the UAE, its ruler is the prime minister and vice president. Following the independence of the UAE in 1971, the government has strived to establish its federal institutions entirely. The complexity of local governments within the seven emirates depends on development and size of each emirate. For example, physically and financially bigger emirates such as Abu Dhabi are further divided into various municipalities in this case two.
</p>

<h2>Overview Of UAE's Government</h2>
<p>Traditionally, regional rulers hold open discussions with their citizens whether they are elite, merchants or ordinary people. Within the UAE, emirate rulers together with senior family members engage in such forums mainly to find ways on which they can make life better for the people through better governance. In regards to the UAE's judiciary branch, its judicial system features both the Sharia law and civil law systems. The UAE court systems comprise of both Sharia courts and civil courts.
